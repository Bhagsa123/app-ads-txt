**Last updated:** November 29, 2025

Videomate (“**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”) is committed to protecting user privacy while delivering an exceptional, cutting-edge video playback experience. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use and share it, and the choices you have. This policy is modelled on standard app privacy frameworks.
