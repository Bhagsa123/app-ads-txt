    <section>
      <p><strong>Videomate</strong> (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) is committed to protecting user privacy while delivering a high-quality video playback experience. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use and share it, and the choices available to you when using the Videomate Player (the &quot;Service&quot;).</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Scope &amp; Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By installing, accessing, or using the Service you accept the collection, use and disclosure of information described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> — information that identifies you or can reasonably identify you (e.g., name, email).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> — non-personal information collected automatically (e.g., device model, OS, playback metrics).</li>
      <li><strong>Service Provider</strong> — third parties supporting our Service (analytics, crash reporting, ads, cloud storage).</li>
      <li><strong>Device</strong> — a smartphone, tablet, or other device running the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data We Collect &amp; Why</h2>
    <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
    <p><strong>Account info (optional):</strong> Email, display name — used for account features, backups, and sync. <br>
       <strong>Support communications:</strong> Messages you send via support channels to resolve issues.</p>

    <h3>B. Automatically Collected Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect telemetry such as device model, OS version, advertising ID (where available), IP address, app version, crash reports, playback metrics (files opened, playback time, buffering), and feature usage to improve reliability, analytics and troubleshooting.</p>

    <h3>C. Media &amp; Storage Access (local)</h3>
    <p>Videomate requests access to your device media (e.g., <code>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code>, <code>READ_MEDIA_VIDEO</code>, or storage access) so it can index and play local video/audio files and display thumbnails. Camera or microphone access is requested only for optional recording features you explicitly enable.</p>

    <h3>D. Location (optional)</h3>
    <p>Approximate location is collected only if you enable location-based features (for localized suggestions or content).</p>

    <h3>E. Advertising &amp; Analytics</h3>
    <p>Advertising identifiers and analytics events may be collected for monetization, ad measurement and (when enabled/consented) ad personalization.</p>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>Where required by law, we rely on one or more lawful bases to process Personal Data: your consent, performance of a contract (providing the Service), compliance with legal obligations, and our legitimate interests (product development, fraud prevention).</p>

    <h2>5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate and maintain the Service;</li>
      <li>Improve and personalize features and recommendations;</li>
      <li>Diagnose technical issues and fix bugs;</li>
      <li>Deliver customer support and communicate updates;</li>
      <li>Serve and measure ads (when enabled); and</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and protect rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> analytics, crash reporting, cloud storage, ad networks (processors under contract).</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliates &amp; partners:</strong> for feature integrations or collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with mergers, acquisitions or asset sales.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> to comply with law or protect rights, safety or property.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"><strong>Statement:</strong> We do not sell your Personal Data for direct monetary consideration.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain Personal Data only as long as necessary to fulfill collection purposes, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements. Usage Data is typically retained for analytics and product improvement for a limited period (months to a few years depending on purpose).</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights &amp; Controls</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, objection/restriction of processing, withdrawal of consent, and data export. To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. Account-level controls are available in app settings when applicable.</p>

    <h2>9. Device Permissions &amp; How to Revoke</h2>
    <p>Videomate requests only the permissions required for enabled features. You can revoke or modify permissions in your device settings (Settings → Apps → Videomate). Revoking permissions may limit app functionality (e.g., removing storage access disables local playback).</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Links &amp; Integrations</h2>
    <p>The Service may integrate third-party SDKs or contain links to external services. Those services maintain separate privacy policies and practices — we are not responsible for their compliance.</p>

    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>We apply industry-standard technical and organizational safeguards to protect Personal Data. No system is 100% secure — absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>12. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you believe your child provided information, contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>13. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored in locations outside your country. Where transfers occur, we put contractual and technical safeguards in place consistent with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy as product features or legal requirements change. Material updates will be posted with a revised &quot;Last updated&quot; date and, when appropriate, communicated via in-app notice or email.</p>
